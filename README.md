# CWM_Python_2018
Welcome to the Python Learn, Practice, Build, and Make Nights with Code With Me! We will go over the basics of Python, talk about Cyber Security, and look over the basics of Machine Learning all with Python and major Python modules.   

## Installing  Python
We can download the latest version of Python 3.6.X [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure you download and install the correct 32-bit or 64-bit for your system.

* Windows: Make sure the checkbox `````"add Python to %PATH%"````` is checked during the instillation.

We can see if Python is installed correctly by bringing up the command prompt and typing in ```> python```. You should now see the version of Python installed and now you can interact with the Python interpreter.

```
>>> 2+2
>>> 2**100
```

## Installing PyCharm
We can download the latest version of the PyCharm IDE [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows). Download the Community Version which is free to use. 

* Configure the Python Interpreter for PyCharm by providing the path to where ```python.exe``` is located.

## Installing Python Modules
Installing Python Modules can be done by typing ```> pip install package_name``` into the command prompt. We can also install packages directly from PyCharm: ```File --> Settings --> Under Project --> Configure Interpreter```. We can click on the green ```+``` to bring up a prompt with Python's official packages.
