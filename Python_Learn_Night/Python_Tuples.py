# Tuples are Python's Immutable version of the Sequence Data Type

tuple1 = (1, 2, "Hello")
tuple2 = (100, )
tuple3 = 10, 20, 30
empty_tuple = tuple()

# because they are immutable we cannot add or remove individual elements
del tuple2

# We still have the basic methods from lists that can be applied to tuples
# len()
# concatenation (+)
# repetition (*)
# "in" method

# Why use tuples?
